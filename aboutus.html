    <h2><strong>Our Team</strong></h2>
    <hr>
    <h3><strong>Christopher Williams</strong></h3>
    <p>Chris retired from the United States Marine Corps in 2019, and is the founding member of Crabs and Bombs.</p>
    <p>He deployed four times to various countries in the Middel-East. He is married with a son that wants to be</p>
    <p>an EOD Technician one day. Chris started the store initially to raise moeny for wounded and fallen EOD Technicians</p>
    <p>and their families. The store has grown since then, and now gives a portion of all sales to the EOD Warrior foundation.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3><strong>Carlos Caldera</strong></h3>
    <p>Andrea Victor is the proud spouse of recently retired AF EOD Tech who now works at the NAVSCOLEOD. Originally from the majestic</p>
    <p>corn and soybean fields of Illinois, she moved to Florida shortly after graduating college. There she met her wonderful</p>
    <p>husband Derrick. From there they started a family and travelled to many exotic places, Little Rock AR and Aviano Italy. In August 2015</p>
    <p>with retirement orders in hand the family moved to Crestview in order to start the second chapter of life. Now she engineers the home-front</p>
    <p>for her 3 beautiful children. During her free time (if any) she enjoys sitting by the beach and her family time and running around to baseball….or art class…or football etc.</p>

    <h3><strong>Michael Harding</strong></h3>
    <p>Kiel spent 13 years in as an Air Force EOD technician before separating to pursue full time education. During his time in EOD he worked with</p>
    <p>all four services as well as other nations on multiple deployments. He started out his EOD career as a team member and then became a team leader</p>
    <p>and finally an instructor at NAVSCOLEOD. He now spends time at work or with his wife Krystle and two children Loki and Halo, while going to</p>
    <p>Northwest Florida State College for Program Management. He strongly agrees with the company’s vison and is happy to be able to continue to contribute to the EOD community.</p>
